##### To host on github
Because of jekyll-scholar plug-in, need to push the precompiled site to github, not the source code.
Easiest way to do this is to navigate to _site, create a new repo there,
delete existing repo called rich-d-wilkinson.github.io
and then do

git remote add origin https://github.com/rich-d-wilkinson/rich-d-wilkinson.github.io.git
git push -u origin master
