<h1 id="statistical-consultancy">Statistical consultancy</h1>

<!--My academic work  specialises on making progress in interdisciplinary problems, where the challenge is to find a common language, to quickly get to the root of a problem, and to communicate solutions clearly and simply.  This
-->

<p>I offer <strong>full service</strong> statistical consultancy, with extensive industrial and academic  experience in</p>

<ul>
  <li>statistical modelling</li>
  <li>Bayesian statistics and uncertainty quantification</li>
  <li>statistical computing in R and Python</li>
  <li>probabilistic machine learning</li>
  <li>digital twin creation and training for engineering, climate, and medicine</li>
  <li>clean and efficient data processing pipelines</li>
  <li>environmental risk models</li>
</ul>

<p>I offer consultancy to businesses either through the data science consultancy  <a href="http://www.damslconsulting.co.uk">DAMSL</a>, or via the University of Nottingham Consultants. DAMSL offer a range of training courses and consultancy services for companies wishing to extract maximum value from their data.</p>

<!--I also run UQ Consulting in partnership with [John Paul Gosling](https://www.maths.leeds.ac.uk/index.php?id=263&uid=1100).  We offer consultancy services for businesses who wish to develop  uncertainty quantification methodologies. This ranges from expert elicitation in substantial practical applications, to more sophisticated mathematical treatments of uncertainty, particularly in the case where there are complex models involved.-->

<!--I have previously worked (or am currently working)  with the following companies:


* Microsoft Research
* Total
* Cogniance
* Improbable Worlds Ltd
* Network Rail
* SCJohnson
* DEB
* Garrad Hassan
* Sea level research Ltd
-->
<!--Examples of previous projects include:-->

<!--#### Uncertainty quantification in whole life costs and asset lifecycle modelling

I spent four months working with Network Rail (the UK rail operator)  to conduct a substantial review  and development of the uncertainty quantification methods used within the company. We focussed on their Whole Life Costs and Asset Life Cycle profiles, and developed methods to account for uncertainties in models of various asset disciplines, with a focus on track, signalling and earthworks.

#### Predictive modelling

Many companies have big datasets which they would like to use to make predictions about the future. The past decade has seen an explosion in the ability of statistical models to learn from data. Gaussian processes (my primary area of research) are one of the key machine learning methods to have emerged, and have had  great success in making predictions from data (while also quantifying uncertainty in those predictions).

-->
<!--Recent consultancy work has included using Gaussian processes to  build an intelligent prediction system for tide levels. By combining historic measurements with the information contained in weather forecasts, it is possible to make more accurate predictions than were previously available.-->

<!--You can read about my Gaussian process work <a href="research2.html">here</a>.-->

<!--#### Statistical education

Many organisations, both public and private sector, are increasingly seeing data as a key corporate asset. Whilst they may have very able and numerate
technical staff, some additional statistical training can help companies realise the potential value in their data.
 Recent work includes providing several days statistical
 training to an energy engineering consultancy, recapping statistical basics, and showcasing recent developments in machine learning and statistical modelling.
