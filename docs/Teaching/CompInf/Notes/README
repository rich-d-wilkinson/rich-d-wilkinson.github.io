For 2019:

Remove bootstrap hypothesis testing.
Could add kernel testing if wanted to make it more interesting?

Add Chapter 4 on Bayesian methods, inc. using IS and Rej with Bayes, and HMC and stan.

In Chapter 3, slides 36+37 are still wrong (on sequential generators). Correct.

For 2018

Change cross validation material. Add some theory, and links to bootstrapping. Read Efrons .632 bootstrap paper. Add some theory to bootstrap section. See CV_boot.pdf in main directory. Also see

Mention links to AIC/BIC etc for evaluating model fit. They aim to estimate the out of sample prediction skill by correcting for complexity.


Instead, do more on sampling and MC. Perhaps do sequential importance sampling? Or ABC? Or something else - see Robert's book for suggestions.

Remove squeezing from the rejection sampling section. For the examples given, this actually slows down the algorithm! It is not interesting to teach or hear either, and is not deep in any sense.


\frame{Next year, add more on IS. Concept of a weighted sample $\{\theta_i, p_i\}$, how to use this to estimate means, quantiles etc. Look at Robert's Monte Carlo with R book.}
