Stan is an example of a probabilistic programming language. It allows us to do Bayesian inference for a particular model, without needing to think to hard about it.


# Basics

## Programmes

## Compiling

## Sampling
Stan uses Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling, a form of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Note that Stan cannot deal with discrete parameters (discrete random variables are fine though).

## Variational inference?
## Optimization?

## Reproducibility
Scripts are good documentation
Seeds


# Examples

## Linear regression
## GLM - logistic and probit regression
## Mixed effect models or hierarchical models
## Time series AR(p), ARMA, ARCH, GARCH?, MA, HMMs
## Missing data? Censored data
## Mixture models?
## Clustering
# GPs
## ODEs
