Far too much waffle. Remove everything after slide 14 - i.e., after the Monte Carlo properties have been described. Slides 22 and 23 are essentially repeated, with a slightly different example in p25-29.

The \pause reveals don't work with annotations as the annotations then disappear as you move from one slide to the next.
