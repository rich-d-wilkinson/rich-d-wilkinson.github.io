<p>This module is concerned with the analysis of multivariate data, in which the response is a vector of random variables rather than a single random variable.</p>

<p>Part I of the module describes some basic concepts in Multivariate Analysis and gives some examples of multivariate data (in Chapter 1), and also contains a summary of the matrix algebra that will be important in this module (Chapter 2).</p>

<p>A theme running through the module is that of dimension reduction. In Part II we consider three types of dimension reduction: Principal Components Analysis (in Chapter 3),
whose purpose is to identify the main modes of variation in a multivariate dataset; Canonical Correlation Analysis (Chapter 4), whose purpose is to describe the association between two sets of variables; and Multidimensional Scaling (Chapter 5), in which the starting point is a set of pairwise distances, suitably defined,  between the objects under study.</p>

<p>In Part III, we focus on methods of inference for multivariate data whose distribution is multivariate normal.  First, in Chapter 6, we develop relevant distribution theory for the multivariate normal distribution.  This includes a study of the Wishart distribution, which is a matrix generalisation of the chi-squared distribution, and Hotellingâ€™s $T^2$, which can be thought of as a multivariate generalisation of the Student $t$ distribution.  Then in Chapter 7 we focus on inference in  multivariate one-sample and two-sample problems in which the underlying distribution is multivariate normal, making use of the distribution theory developed in Chapter 6.  In Chapter 8, we focus on the multivariate linear model in which the dependent variable (or $y$ variable) is a vector and the error distribution is multivariate normal.</p>

<p>Finally, in Part IV, we focus on different methods of classification, i.e. allocating the observations in a sample to different subsets (or groups).  In Chapter 9, we focus on an approach called discriminant analysis, in which we have a training sample available, and we use this training sample to set up a suitable classification rule.   In Chapter 10, we consider an alternative approach, known as cluster analysis, in which we allocate the observations into clusters (or similar subsets) when a training sample is not available.</p>
