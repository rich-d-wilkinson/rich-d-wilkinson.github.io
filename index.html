<p>I am  Professor of Statistics in the School of Mathematical Sciences  at the University of Nottingham.
I work on developing statistical methodology for the analysis of complex scientific problems, particularly those that involve the use of computer simulators.</p>

<p>My aim is to work closely with scientists to help them build tools and methodologies to extract as much information as possible from their data and simulator.</p>

<h3 id="brief-bio">Brief bio</h3>

<ul>
  <li>I studied Mathematics at the University of Cambridge from 1999 to 2008. My PhD was supervised by Professor <a href="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/st321/CRUK_CI.html">Simon Tavaré</a> and was on the <i>Bayesian inference of primate divergence times</i>. In 2003-04 I took a gap year, during which I taught  A-Level physics.</li>
  <li>I did an RCUK funded postdoc (2008-2009) on the  <a href="http://www.mucm.ac.uk/">Managing Uncertainty in Complex Models project</a> project, working under the supervision of
<a href="http://www.jeremy-oakley.staff.shef.ac.uk/"> Jeremy Oakley </a> and <a href="http://www.tonyohagan.co.uk/academic/"> Tony O’Hagan</a>.</li>
  <li>From 2009 to 2015 I was a lecturer in the School of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Nottingham.</li>
  <li>From 2015-2020 I was senior lecturer, and then (from 2018), professor of statistics at the  University of Sheffield.</li>
  <li>September 2020 onwards,  Professor of Statistics at the University of Nottingham.</li>

<!--I am professor of statistics in the School of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Sheffield. From 2009-2015 I was assistant professor in the School of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Nottingham, before moving to Sheffield to become senior lecturer in 2015, and then professor of statistics in 2018.
From 1999-2008 I was a maths student at the University of Cambridge. My PhD was supervised by Professor <a href="http://www.cmb.usc.edu/people/stavare/Tavare.html">Simon Tavar&eacute;</a> in the  Department of Applied Maths and Theoretical Physics   (<a href="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/">DAMTP</a>) and  my <a href="docs/PhD_thesis.pdf"> PhD thesis </a> was on the <i>Bayesian inference of primate divergence times</i>.  After my PhD, I did a two year  RCUK funded project on Managing Uncertainty in Complex Models project (<a href="http://mucm.group.shef.ac.uk/">MUCM</a>), working under the supervision of
<a href="http://www.jeremy-oakley.staff.shef.ac.uk/"> Jeremy Oakley </a> and <a href="http://www.tonyohagan.co.uk/academic/"> Tony O'Hagan</a>. Between  studying for the part III maths tripos and my PhD,  I spent a year as an A-Level Physics teacher.-->

<p>I live in Sheffield with my wife, eight  year old daughter, and five year old son. In my spare time, I like to feed my cycling addiction and  play the piano.</p>
