<p>My main research interests lie in the field of Bayesian statistics and its application. In particular, I am interested in the statistical challenges posed by computer experiments.</p>

<p>David Cox said in a recent <a href="http://www.statisticsviews.com/details/feature/5770651/I-would-like-to-think-of-myself-as-a-scientist-who-happens-largely-to-specialise.html">interview</a> that the <font color="red">
'challenge [...] for an academic statistician, is to be involved in several fields of application in a non-trivial sense and combine the stimulus and the contribution you can make that way with theoretical contributions that those contacts will suggest'</font> and this captures perfectly  my research strategy: to be involved in several application areas and work on  interesting methodology as it arises.</p>

   <a name="ABC"></a>           <h2><font color="green">Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC)</font></h2>&lt;/a&gt;


<p>ABC methods are a class on Monte Carlo method that arose out of genetics and has been extensively studied in the past decade. The methods can be used for doing Bayesian inference
when the likelihood function can't be evaluated directly, but can be simulated from. This situation is common in many scientific fields, where it is easy to code  a physical model that simulates some data, but which is difficult to analyse mathematically.
A simple way to perform calibration in these models is via Approximate Bayesian Computation.

<p>
If we let &#952; represent
the model  parameters,  x the observed data, and S(x) some summary statistic
of the data, then the basic
ABC algorithm is as follows:


&lt;ol type=2&gt;
<li> Choose &#952; from  the prior  </li>

<li> Simulate  data x' from the model with  parameter  &#952;, and calculate
 S'=S(x').</li>

<li> Accept  &#952;  if  simulated statistic S' is close to the summary of the
real data S=S(x).
i.e accept if &#961;(S, S') &lt;&#949;, where &#961; represents a carefully chosen
metric. </li>

&lt;/ol&gt;

<p>The main advantage of ABC is that is easy to code  and can be used in nearly all modelling situations. It doesn't necessarily require extensive statistical knowledge,
and so is an important tool for scientists who wish to fit their model to data, but who might not have experience with complex likelihood calculations and MCMC.
The key challenge for statisticians is developing algorithms that can be easily applied, and give accurate inference.
</p>




<p> The focus of much of my current research is on trying to speed up ABC algorithms so that they can be used with more computationally expensive simulators.

<br />
Computer experiments are now commonplace  in nearly all areas of science. From a statistical point of view, the main question is,  how  we can  learn about a physical system from a  simulation of it?
For deterministic simulators, if we run the model multiple times with the same input, we will get the same output each time. Because there is no natural variation we must introduce and account for uncertainty ourselves, in order to make predictions with sensible error bounds. An excellent source of information on some of the methods for dealing with computer experiments can be found in the <a href="http://mucm.aston.ac.uk/MUCM/MUCMToolkit/">MUCM toolkit</a>.

<p>
I am interested in two main problems:
&lt;ol type=I&gt;
<li>Dealing with code uncertainty - if the simulator is expensive to run, we will have to conduct all inference using a small ensemble of model runs. One approach to dealing with this, is to build an <em>emulator</em> of the simulator. In other words, we build a cheap statistical model of the expensive computer model.</li>

<li>Model error - if we accept that a model is imperfect, then it is natural to ask whether we can learn in what way the model goes wrong, and whether we can correct the error. Related to this is the question of whether we can learn the appropriate degree of uncertainty we must add to our inference in order to make sensible predictions.
		This work has close links to some of my  <a href="#ABC">ABC</a> work.

</p>
&lt;/ol&gt;

<p> Gaussian processes are used to tackle both of these problems, as they provide a flexible non-parametric family of models that is easy to work with. Some papers:

<p>Climate models  tend to be expensive and deterministic, typically depending on many unknown parameters. The models are also imperfect, in the sense that there  are physical processes missing from the models and  approximating assumptions need to be made in order to solve the equations. The data can also be sparse and in the case of palaeodata, very noise. All these are reasons why I think climate science is a great area to work in.</p>




<p align="justify">
 I am interested in work which incorporates statistical modelling into the analysis in order to produce predictions/explanations that account for the various uncertainties we know to exist (code uncertainty, parametric uncertainty, model error, measurement errors). It is important to produce probabilistic predictions, as deterministic predictions (which scientists understand to be approximate) are often interpreted (by skeptics)  as undermining all of climate science if they do not occur exactly as promised.

<section class="main_content">

<p>
Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is the process of capturing the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions produced in the generation of electricity from fossil fuels, and then burying the captured CO<sub>2</sub> underground. I am involved in several CCS projects.
</p>


<p>The first, is through involvement in the
<a href="http://panacea-co2.org"><img class="imageStyle" alt="" src="images/panacea.png" width="20%" /></a>
project, an EU funded consortium across 12 Universities. In Nottingham, we are responsible for the uncertainty quantification. The main question we wish to answer, is given that the geology of the underlying bedrock is unknown, what do we believe the likely distribution is for how the  buried CO<sub>2</sub> will permeate through the bedrock? This involves building Gaussian process emulators of complex ground water flow models. The dimension of the input and outputs to this simulator can be very high (d=10<sup>5</sup> is typical), and so we are investigating dimension reduction techniques for accurately capturing the simulator behaviour.


<div class="logo">
<a href="http://www.panacea-co2.org/"><img class="imageStyle" alt="" src="images/panacea_group2.jpg" width="70%" /></a>
</div>


</p>

<p>The second CCS project is looking at  modelling impure CO2 properties, which is important in the transport of CO<sub>2</sub>. This ranges from training empirical parametric models, to non-parametric Gaussian process models where we allow the functional form of the model to arise from the data itself, rather than being postulated in advance.
</p>

<p> Finally, we have been looking at ab-initio molecular simulation. A particular feature of our approach is to integrate techniques across different length scales, aiming to produce highly tractable models that are informed by the more expensive molecular techniques.
We have been using Gaussian processes to feed information about the molecular interactions from techniques in computational chemistry calculations into the simulation. Ultimately, we hope this will lead to completely ab-initio computation of physical properties.


&lt;/div&gt;
